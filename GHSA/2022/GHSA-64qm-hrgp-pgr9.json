If a cookie is readable\n> by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a\n> service running on another port of the same server.  If a cookie is\n> writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a\n> service running on another port of the same server.  For this\n> reason, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on\n> different ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-\n> sensitive information.\n",
